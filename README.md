# gmail-empty-trash
Simple script to empty your gmail trash

Since the setting to automatically delete trash is not configurable
and only happens every 30 days, you can use this to empty your trash
on a more regular basis using a crontask.

## Usage

```shell
$ pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
$ python empty-trash.py
```

Requires Python 3
